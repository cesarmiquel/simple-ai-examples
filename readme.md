# Samples

This repository has several toy training sets and examples for experimenting with a simple
two layer neural network (NN). In each example you have a `LearnCard.xlsx` spreadsheet which
has the training set. With this training set we can teach the neural network to recognize patterns
in the input data. The `LearnCard.xlsx` spreadsheet has the input to the trained network to
assess if it 'learned' the training data.

Currently we have the following examples:

- `example-1/` has a training set to make the NN recognize islands of "1"'s surrounded by "0"'s
- `example-2/` has a training set to make the NN recognize always increasing secuences
